# Design Pattern Study


## Introduction

This repository goal is to study and improve the knowledge of design patterns and code SOLID.

## Design patterns 

### Creational :
- **Factory** : Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

- **Abstract Factory** : Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

- **Singleton** : Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

- **Builder** : Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

- **Prototype** : Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

### Structural :

- **Adapter** : Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

- **Bridge** : Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.
